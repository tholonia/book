# Introduction

The concept that our reality is an illusion, a matrix, a simulation, or a dream is not new. From the earliest creation stories to our modern version of the Simulation Hypothesis, the story has always been the same: something appeared out of nothing. The details are left to our imagination, and there are countless perspectives on what this means for the meaning and purpose of life.

This book does not attempt to answer any of these questions. Instead, it presents a **blueprint of creation**, similar to a **blueprint of a house**. A **blueprint only speaks to how a house is built**, not what happens inside the house, how it will be used, or who did the actual building.

The ideas and conclusions put forth in this book apply to society and culture, as well as science, politics, economics, self-realization, consciousness, and life itself. I have attempted to avoid social and cultural biases as much as possible, and where they do exist, I have kept them to a minimum. The overarching concept being presented is the idea that the **mechanics of existence and reality**, from atoms to cultures to galaxies, all follow the same laws and have the same **structure as it applies to their context**.

This book is the result of years of investigation, research, and testing, most of which would be considered unorthodox, and little of which would be considered strictly scientific by today's standards, but all of which is transparently reasonable.  The book itself is part of that research, as it an attempt to integrate a collection of hypotheses, proofs, speculations, assumptions, deductions, and questions, all of which could benefit from corrections, improvements, tests, and general finessing from the community at large.

The conclusions in this book are my own, drawn from connecting the **dots laid out in the following pages**. It is not my intention to promote my conclusions, but rather to use them as examples of how one person has connected these dots. It is these **dots that give clues to the structure of reality and existence**, but as there are countless dots, there are innumerable perspectives and understandings. How we connect them is a subjective experience, so you may connect these dots differently, or you may not see anything worth connecting at all.

This book is written in the style of an argumentative proposal. Despite its occasional meandering, the progression of concepts presented attempts to maintain continuity with (hopefully) clear points, references, and a (somewhat) logical order of subjects. It is also an exploration into new territory that I am certainly not an expert in. That is why this book is open-sourced; to allow others' insights and knowledge to be integrated with the hope that a clearer picture of the mechanics of existential awareness will continue to evolve and emerge, allowing for corrections and updates.

The book is sectioned into three parts:

* **Part I** introduces the ideas and concepts that form the vocabulary later used to describe the tholonic model presented. These are not esoteric or niche concepts but the most fundamental concepts known to science, such as energy, chaos, order, waves, and Newton's laws. As we review these basic concepts, we also expand on them and build new concepts that will be critical in describing what role awareness plays in the theater of existence, how and why consciousness had to evolve, and the nature of intelligence, be it artificial, human, or otherwise.
* **Part II** brings together the ideas and concepts of Part I either directly or indirectly and examines the structure of reality and our concepts of how it operates, as it is these stuctures that also define the concepts of data, information, knowledge, and understanding.
* **Part III** looks at the application of tholonic concepts, specifically, in how ideas and concepts form our understanding of reality.

There are also a number of appendixes that have interesting and relevant information that did not did not fit into the body of the text.

**On a more mundane note…**

Please read Appendix A, "About This Book," to understand why this book is written using an unconventional style of punctuation, grammar, and spacing. It also addresses some technical eBook issues that the reader may find distracting.

I hope you enjoy reading this book as much as I enjoyed writing it.
